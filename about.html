        <p>A little about me, my name is Kadon Crawford. I am a sophomore here at Kennesaw State University. I was born and rasied in Georgia but I have moved around within the state. Some fun facts include my favorite color is purple, my favorite sport is basketball, and I love to eat and lounge around. I am enjoying this class and the challneges that it brings. I want to be able to conquer anything that is thrown at me.</p>

The HTML will organize content into semantic sections such as headers and footers which ensures accessibility and easy navigation. The CSS is used to maintain consistent colors and spacing. The flexbox and media provides aresponsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.</p>
