      <h2>HTTP History</h2>
      <p> - Over the years ranging from when it was created all the way to today, HTTP has had 5
versions. HTTP/0.9 which was made in 1991 was the very first. The original HTTP proposal was
made by a man named Tim Berners-Lee. It was a small protocol and very limited. It was initially
made to exchange information for the World Wide Web. Only one line request could return
HTML and no headers. It was just good enough for the World Wide Web’s earliest pages but
lacked extensibility. In the mid to late 1990s, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 came along. It allowed for
more benefits and new additions such as headers, persistent connections, and caching controls.
This was all included in HTTP/1.0. In 1997, HTTP/1.1 was standardized. It fixed issues such as
interoperability problems which is essentially a wall preventing different computer systems,
devices, and applications from exchanging and using data. The next HTTP update wouldn’t be
all the way until 2015 which introduces HTTP/2. HTTP/2 was designed to solve performance
issues inherent to prior HTTP versions. HTTP/2 introduced things such as binary framing,
header compression, and optional server pushes. These changes aimed to reduce latency and
make better use of network resources. The final and most up to date version of HTTP is HTTP/3
which was introduced in 2022. HTTP semantics were mapped onto QUIC which was developed
by GOOGLE. QUIC stands for Quick UDP Internet Connections and UDP stands for User
Datagram Protocol. It integrates TLS or Transport Layer Security and allows for QUIC to
provide faster connection establishment, improved loss recovery, and better mobility
characteristics.
</p>
<p> - HTTP had to change over the course of the years as web pages started to grow and
needed to hold more and more information. Web pages grew from small one line and small
headers to holding hundreds of objects per page. The performance of web pages needs to
improve so HTTP has to improve. Security also needed to improve as the World Wide Web
matured to protect its users and clients from threats. Modern versions of HTTP protect and help
encrypt important and personal data like adding an extra layer of security and protection. Major
browsers and platforms now default to secure connections.
</p>
<p> - HTTP is currently ubiquitous or found everywhere on virtually all computers and
devices. Major browsers, servers and cloud platforms support HTTP/3 and even so, HTTP/3’s
usage is steadily increasing. Major browsers and large content platforms such as GOOGLE and
CloudFare predict and estimate that its traffic share of HTTP/3 will be over 40% by the end of
2025. HTTP/2 does still exist and it is still available but it is dominated by its newer counterpart
of HTTP/3. It is now more largely confined to static websites where security is not a primary
concern.

      <ol class="Key-Points">
        <li>HTTP/0.9, which was made in 1991, was the first version and was created by Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
        <li>HTTP soon evoloved through many different versions until the most recent adaption of HTTP/3.</li>
        <li>As web pages grew in size and complexity, the performance and speed needed improvement as well as the security.</li>
        <li>HTTP is supported by virtually all browsers, servers, and cloud platforms.</li>
