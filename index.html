  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is essentially the foundation of the World Wide
Web. HTTP is used to load webpages using hypertext links and shapes everything from simple
web pages to complex microservices. Even though it seems as simple as a URL in the address
bar, it is far more complex. HTTP has had major redesigns over three decades to improve
performance, security, and reliability. This essay will analyze and examine HTTP’s role and
purpose as well as the current status and its history and evolution. Ranging from HTTP/0.9 of the
past to HTTP/3 of the present and any version to come in the future, HTTP is a very interesting
topic with lots of information to digest
  </p>
  <p>One of the most notable people involved with HTTP is Tim Berners-Lee who is basically
the inventor of the World Wide Web and first and initial HTTP concepts. His proposals and ideas
set the Web’s original architecture. Another notable person is a man named Roy Fielding. He was
the lead author on one of HTTP’s first major upgrades which was HTTP/1.1. He was also
involved in the rest but mainly the HTTP/1.1. Also, industry implementers like Google, Mozilla,
Apple, Microsoft, and Cloudflare all played roles in testing and deploying new protocol features.
They experiment on HTTP to improve upon it and turn it into something much better and even
more useful.</p>
