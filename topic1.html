      <h2>HTTP Basics</h2>
      <p> - HTTP is an application level request response protocol. A user opens a connection to a
server, sends a request, and then the server returns a response. HTTP is a generic interface for
resource interaction on the Web. Its purpose is not only to retrieve hypertext documents but also
provide a portable and generic interface that other applications can reuse. Basically, a design that
can enable the Web's explosive growth.</p>

<p> - HTTP generally works on a request and response basis. The web browser or application
sends a request to a web server and the server then responds to the request by providing the
necessary and requested data. As stated in the referenced article, an example is when entering a
URL address in your browser address bar and then you hit enter, the browser sends an HTTP
request to the server hosting that web page. The server processes the request and sends back an
HTTP response which contains the requested information. The information in this case would be
what is necessary to load up the website. The browser then receives and processes the response
and this is how the web page appears on your browser screen. These exchanges of requests and
responses let whoever retrieve web pages, send data to servers and perform operations over the
internet.</p>

      <h3><strong>Important Points - </strong></h3>
      <ul class="important-points">
        <li>HTTP is a protocol used for communication between a client and a Server</li>
        <li>It defines a basic interface for interaction with web resources and can be reused by many applications</li>
        <li>The request response exchanges are what allows users to retrieve different webpages, send any data, and perform operations across the internet</li>
      </ul>
